modified the approach outlined in "A Fast and Robust Ellipse Detection-Method ..." (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261999152_A_Fast_and_Robust_Ellipse-Detection_Method_Based_on_Sorted_Merging) to use line segments and calculated curvature to repair errors in edge maps caused by noise or occlusion.
